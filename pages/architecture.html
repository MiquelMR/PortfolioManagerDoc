<p class="title-section">Logical Architecture Overview</p>
<p class="sub-title-p">Logical and physical architecture</p>
<p> The Portfolio Manager application is structured into three distinct components,
    following a clear separation of concerns:</p>

<p><b># Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) Client</b></p>
<p>Serves as the presentation layer and is responsible for managing the user interface and
    client-side logic. It includes service classes that handle communication with the
    backend via HTTP requests.</p>
<p><b># Blazor Server Backend</b></p>
<p> Functions as the application's server-side component. It exposes a set of API endpoints,
    encapsulates business logic through application services, and manages data access
    operations. All interactions with the database are performed here.</p>
<p><b># MySQL Database</b></p>
<p>Acts as the persistent data store for the application, containing all structured data
    required for system operation.
    This architectural separation supports multiple physical deployment strategies and
    enables the client to maintain partial functionality in offline or intermittent
    connectivity scenarios</p>

<p class="title-sub-section"># Client : Web Assembly</p>
<p>The Portfolio Manager frontend is deployed as a WebAssembly (Wasm) module. In the context of ASP.NET,
    this means the application is compiled from C# into a portable WebAssembly format, enabling it to run in
    the browser at near-native speed. This approach leverages the benefits of .NET Blazor WebAssembly,
    allowing rich, interactive UI experiences entirely on the client side without requiring constant server
    communication.</p>

<!--Data flow-->
<p class="title-sub-section"># Client : Data Flow</p>
<p>When the view needs a piece of data to render an element, it follows this sequence:</p>
<ul>
    <li>- The view binds its component state to data defined in the code-behind. <br><em>Example:
            Home.html</em></li>
    <li>- The code-behind retrieves this data from the ViewModel. <br><em>Example: Home.cs</em></li>
    <li>- The ViewModel serves as the central point for business logic and data access. <br><em>Example:
            ViewModel.cs</em></li>
    <li>- The ViewModel communicates with services to fetch or update data. <br><em>Example:
            _financialAssetService.UpdateFinancialAsset()</em></li>
</ul>
<p> Not all operations require accessing or sending data outside the Presentation layer. In such cases,
    the
    view does not interact with the ViewModel. Instead, the code-behind directly modifies the bound
    data.

    Example: A button that toggles the visibility of a UI component.</p>
<p class="title-sub-section"># Client : Pages and components</p>

<p>WebAssembly utilizes a hierarchy of renderable elements, which consists of Pages and Components.
    In
    this structure, Components function as objects, encapsulating specific functionality and UI
    elements. In this case, when access to the ViewModel is required, delegates are used to bind
    methods
    from the component.</p>
