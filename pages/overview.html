    Abstract

    The economic situation and its impact on people's lives have shown their less favourable side in recent years:
    unemployment, economic crises, uncertainty, and, more recently, inflation. As a result, individuals are forced to
    make financial decisions that allow them to avoid or at least
    mitigate the most impoverishing effects of economic reality. In some cases, these decisions may lead them to prosper
    through work and savings. However, it is precisely the complexity of the economic world that makes difficult or even
    impossible to reach valid conclusions about which financial decisions should be made. Although the solution is also
    complex, technology can assist with this endeavour.
    Portfolio Manager emerges as a practical and accessible solution designed to help users manage their investments by
    providing information on financial assets, analysis of their behaviour in different economic environments, and
    investment strategies. Additionally, it has been conceived as an application to foster knowledge sharing within a
    community.
    Thanks to its architecture based on WebAssembly and a cloud-hosted API, Portfolio Manager enables users to access
    financial information in real time from any browser without requiring additional software installation. Furthermore,
    its scalable design ensures that the platform can continuously evolve and improve after its launch.
    Ultimately, Portfolio Manager is a tool to organise personal investments that delivers its services through the
    cloud. Besides, it includes a space to share investment ideas and has been designed to be scalable
